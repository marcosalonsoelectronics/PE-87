Material of video PE #87: Simple Dynamic Model of Power MOSFETs

Available at: https://youtu.be/fdH6md_RPXk

This video shows how to create a simple dynamic model of power MOSFETs. The goal of this model is to have access to the internal elements of the MOSFET so that its dynamic behavior can be better understood. This model will be used in future videos to show the switching behavior of the transistor. The video also shows two versions of the model with linear parasitic capacitances and non-linear parasitic capacitances.
